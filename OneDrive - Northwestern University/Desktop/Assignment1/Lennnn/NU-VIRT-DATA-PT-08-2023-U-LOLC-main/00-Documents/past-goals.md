## Past Goals  

<br>

**Goals for Week 1** 
- [x] Make sure to have Excel installed on your computer (used from Day 2 to Day 6)
- [x] Make sure you can sign into Slack and can see at least these channels: `01-Live`, `02-ask-the-class`, `03-resources`, `general`.  
- [x] Read this Slack post about Learning Resources from the `#general` channel: [LINK](https://nuvirtdatapt0-isb1330.slack.com/archives/C05GJFQ645P/p1693239839682549)  
- [x] Be able to login to GitLab (aka Class Repository, aka Class Repo):  [LINK](https://git.bootcampcontent.com/) 
- [x] Be able to login to Bootcamp Spot (aka BCS, aka Canvas): [LINK](https://courses.bootcampspot.com/)
- [x] Setup SSH Keys (instructions below) by **September 7th** - if needed, seek help during office hours.  Note: I personally like using the SSH keys for both Github and GitLab versus using Personal Access Tokens.  The prework shows how to setup HTTPS Personal Access Tokens for Github but I don't think there are any instructions about doing the same for GitLab.  It has been a long time since I used a token but I think there are several extra steps to get both Github and GitLab to work with the token method; hence, why I included SSH instructions.  

**Note**:  More support documents related to installing and verifying that installations work will be provided during the first week.  We will concentrate on Excel and making sure you have access to the above resources then we will concentrate on making sure you have a working version of git, python, and VSCode.

**Goals for Week 2**
  - [x] Priority for the weekend:  Work on Module 1 Excel Homework - bring questions to office hours, tryout some of the other learning resources.  
  - [x] Suggestion:  Read the VBA Homework Instructions so as we do class next week you can identify important parts of the lessons.
  - [x] Complete SSH Key Setup (due by September 7th)
  - [x] Install Python - See Slack Message (#03-Resources/Thursday@6:43pm) [LINK](https://nuvirtdatapt0-isb1330.slack.com/archives/C05G2UQEJBF/p1693525394844259)
  - [x] Complete Install Check - See Slack Message [LINK](https://nuvirtdatapt0-isb1330.slack.com/archives/C05G2UQEJBF/p1693280513956409)
  - [ ] If you have time and you have your SSH Keys setup, Try This Git Task [LINK](./00-Documents/git-starter.md)
  - [ ] If you have time and you did the above task, Try to make a README.md [LINK](./00-Documents/readme-guide.md).  
    * Try to make a simple README.md file for Module 3 Python Homework submission if you don't have time during the first two weeks of the class.  

  **Note**:  Near the end of week 2, I will give you instructions to setup a few things in VSCode and python.  This will save some time when we start Python Day 1.
